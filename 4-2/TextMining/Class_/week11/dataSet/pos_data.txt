Boris Johnson noisily quit as UK Foreign Secretary in July over the Prime Minister's plans to leave the European Union.
Now his lesser-known brother Jo, who was also a government minister, has followed him out.
The two Johnsons were on opposing sides in the 2016 referendum, but they have since come to the same conclusion: May's plan to leave the EU is a dud.
His resignation will likely come as a blow to May as she seeks to win the backing of her Cabinet in the coming days for the government's proposed deal, which will then be put to a vote in parliament.
The death toll in the Camp Fire in Northern California has risen to 23 with the discovery Saturday of 14 more sets of remains, Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea told reporters.
Honea said 10 of the victims were recovered from the fire-ravaged town of Paradise.
He said seven people were found in homes, and three were outside.
Of the remaining four, two were in cars and two were in houses in an area known as Concow.
Saturday brought a break in the fierce winds that have whipped the three major wildfires in California that have destroyed a record number of buildings and displaced more than 300,000 people.
But officials know the gusts will be back Sunday and most evacuation orders remain in place.
Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen told reporters.
He said he cautioned his firefighters and the public not to be lulled by the better weather Saturday.
Fire has killed nine people in Northern California and possibly two in Southern California.
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Chief John Benedict said the charred remains of two people were found in a car in Malibu, but homicide investigators were still working the case.
Winds could gust as high as 30 to 50 mph, depending on elevation, on Sunday, officials said.
Much of the state hasn't seen rain in more than a month, according to CNN meteorologists, and the dry vegetation has only served to fuel the fires.
